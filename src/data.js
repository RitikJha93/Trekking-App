Right from the very first campsite,  you are in the wilderness. Trekking through lush green forests Once the trail moves out of the forest, the view of the Yamuna valley below opens up to the westpockets of villages and their farms dotting the hills. During spring, this section of trail has a flowers that almost obscures the grass!And to the east, the Greater Himalayan range — Kalanag, Swargarohini, Gangotri I, II, III, BhrigupanthKedarnath — and a plethora of other mountains open up in a sweeping panorama.The wildlife sanctuary is also home to a variety of flora and fauna. Himalayan Goats, Barking Deer, Langurs and Mountain Quails can be spotted by keen observers.

But that’s not the full picture. You see the Annapurna massif at distance (even closer than on the ABC trek). You see the Mt Machapuchare as glorious as ever. You Nilgiri North and South.

That’s a lot for any trek — especially as close to the eyes as on the Goechala trek. It is no wonder that trekkers consider Goechala to be the closest to the big mountain treks of Nepal.Before we dive into the details about Goechala trek, here is a little backdrop of why Goechala is wellamong trekkers all over the world: While the trail to Goechala is an old one, it wasn’t always so famous. The change came about Nepalese Civil War which lasted from 1996 to 2006.Disturbances in Nepal during this time shut the country to trekkers. Suddenly trekking to mountains of the world was out of bounds. It was a huge blow to the trekkers who frantically for alternatives.At that time, Goechala emerged as the closest solace. The trail promised a brilliant close-up to highest mountain of the world and offered breathtaking views of the Singalila range from the Dzongri top.",
